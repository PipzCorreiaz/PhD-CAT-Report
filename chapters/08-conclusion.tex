\chapter{Conclusion and Plan of Work}
\label{chapter:conclusion}

The current document reports an on-going dissertation on the topic of robotic teammates. In particular, this thesis explores the following research problem:

%reinforce why cohesion

\begin{indented}
How can we endow a social robot with the ability to improve the cohesive alliance in a team setting with humans?
\end{indented}

Our approach to address this problem consists of exploring two research goals. One of them is focused on investigating how human-robot teams are established, in particular analysing the perspective of human teammates on how should social robots integrate these teams. It involves the understanding of how people perceive robotic teammates, what people expect from them, or even what attitudes and predispositions people have towards them. Additionally, this research goal raises interesting challenges related to methodological aspects of analysing group interactions. From the careful selection of the group measures, to the adequate design of experiments, or even the correct statistical analysis of individual- and group-level factors.

The second research goal, on the other hand, is focused on the perspective of the social robot and what computational mechanisms it can apply in order to increase the effectiveness of the team. Such goal may also involve several challenges from the autonomous decision-making process, to its perceptive capabilities, or even to the authoring of its social behaviours. The current contributions to this research goal explore novel approaches for the decision-making of robotic teammates.

Overall,

\section{Work Plan}
%Additionally, the future work we have proposed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:future-work} also aims at contributing to this research goal by enhancing the perceptive capabilities of robotic teammates.
According to the proposed work detailed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:future-work}, we are currently considering a sequence of three user studies. \textit{Study 1} aims at collecting data from human participants playing a collaborative game and negotiating with team members in order to later develop the behaviours of a robotic teammate that will play the same game. In \textit{Study 2}, human participants will play together with a robot and the data collection will allow us to analyse communication patterns of the team when there is a robotic partner. Finally, the \textit{Study 3} will explore adaptive mechanisms on the behaviours of the robot and their impact on the communication network of the team.

\section*{\centering*}
This dissertation proposes two research goals that address the research problem by two different perspectives. These research goals hold complementary and, at a certain extent, interdependent challenges that reflect the interdisciplinarity of the HRI field. Overall, we believe its contributions strongly support and enhance research on group interactions with robotic teammates.
