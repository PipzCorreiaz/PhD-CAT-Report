abstract = {A collaborative robot needs to be able to regulate and manage shared goals during collaboration. Emotion has a crucial influence on this goal management process. In this paper, we provide a cost function that we use to choose the goal in the shared plan with the lowest cost value out of a set of alternative goals. This cost function is a) based on the goal attributes, b) with respect to the reverse appraisal of the perceived emotion, and c) the appraisal of the collaborative environment. I.},

@article{Koschate2016,
abstract = {In this paper we show empirically that highly humanlike robots make thoughts of death more accessible, leading to perceptions of uncanniness and eeriness of such robots. Rather than reducing the humanlikeness of robots, our research suggests the addition of emotion displays to decrease a sense of uncanniness. We show that a highly humanlike robot displaying emotions in a social context reduces death-thought accessibility (DTA), which in turn reduces uncanniness. In a pre-test with N = 95 participants, we established that not all humanoid robots elicit thoughts of death and that the extent to which a robot appears humanlike may be linked to DTA. In our Main Study, N = 44 participants briefly interacted with a highly humanlike robotic head that either showed appropriate basic emotions or reacted by blinking. The display of emotions significantly reduced perceptions of uncanniness, which was mediated by a corresponding reduction in DTA. Implications for the design of humanoid robots are proposed.},

@article{Hoffman2004,
abstract = {Many new applications for robots require them to work alongside people as capable members of human-robot teams. These include - in the long term - robots for homes, hospitals, and offices, but already exist in more advanced settings, such as space exploration. The work reported in this paper is part of an ongoing collaboration with NASA JSC to develop Robonaut, a humanoid robot envisioned to work with human astronauts on maintenance operations for space missions. To date, work with Robonaut has mainly investigated performing a joint task with a human in which the robot is being teleoperated. However, perceptive disorientation, sensory noise, and control delays make teleoperation cognitively exhausting even for a highly skilled operator. Control delays in long range teleoperation also make shoulder-to-shoulder teamwork difficult. These issues motivate our work to make robots collaborating with people more autonomous. Our work focuses on a scenario of a human and an autonomous humanoid robot working together shoulder-to-shoulder, sharing the workspace and the objects required to complete a task. A robotic member of such a team must be able to work towards a shared goal, and be in agreement with the human as to the sequence of actions that will be required},

@article{Sandoval2016,
abstract = {Reciprocity is an important factor in human–human interaction, so it can be expected that it should also play a major role in human–robot interaction (HRI). Participants in our study played the Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Game (RPDG) and the mini Ultimatum Game (mUG) with robot and human agents, with the agents using either Tit for Tat (TfT) or Random strategies. As part of the study we also measured the perceived personality traits in the agents using the TIPI test after every round of RPDG and mUG. The results show that the participants collaborated more with humans than with a robot, however they tended to be equally reciprocal with both agents. The experiment also showed the TfT strategy as the most profitable strategy; affecting collaboration, reciprocation, profit and joint profit in the game. Most of the participants tended to be fairer with the human agent in mUG. Furthermore, robots were perceived as less open and agreeable than humans. Consciousness, extroversion and emotional stability were perceived roughly the same in humans and robots. TfT strategy became associated with an extroverted and agreeable personality in the agents. We could observe that the norm of reciprocity applied in HRI has potential implications for robot design. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {The authors investigated basic properties of social exchange and interaction with technology in an experiment on cooperation with a human-like computer partner or a real human partner. Talking with a computer partner may trigger social identity feelings or commitment norms. Participants played a prisoner's dilemma game with a confederate or a computer partner. Discussion, inducements to make promises, and partner cooperation varied across trials. On Trial 1, after discussion, most participants proposed cooperation. They kept their promises as much with a text-only computer as with a person, but less with a more human-like computer. Cooperation dropped sharply when any partner avoided discussion. The strong impact of discussion fits a social contract explanation of cooperation following discussion. Participants broke their promises to a computer more than to a person, however, indicating that people make heterogeneous commitments.},

@article{Terada2017,
abstract = {In the present study, we investigated whether expressing emotional states using a simple line drawing to represent a robot's face can serve to elicit altruistic behaviour from humans. An experimental investigation was conducted in which human participants interacted with a humanoid robot whose facial expression was shown on an LCD monitor that was mounted as its head (Study 1). Participants were asked to play the ultimatum bargaining game, which is usually used to measure human altruistic behaviour. All participants were assigned to be the proposer and were instructed to decide their offer within one minute by controlling a slider bar. The corners of the robot's mouth, as indicated by the line drawing, simply moved upward or downward depending on the position of the slider bar. The results suggest that the change in the facial expression depicted by a simple line drawing of a face significantly affected the participant's final offer in the ultimatum game. The offers were increased by thirteen percent when subjects were shown contingent changes of facial expression. The results were compared with an experiment in a teleoperation setting in which participants interacted with another person through a computer display showing the same line drawings used in Study 1 (Study 2). The results showed that offers were fifteen percent higher if participants were shown a contingent facial expression change. Together, Studies 1 and 2 indicate that emotional expression in simple line drawings of a robot's face elicits the same higher offer from humans as a human telepresence does.},

@article{Nishio2012,
abstract = {In this study, we examine the factors with which robots are recognized as social beings. Participants joined sessions of the Ultimatum Game, a procedure commonly used for examining attitudes toward others in the fields of economics and social psychology. Several agents differing in their appearances are tested with speech stimuli that are expected to induce a mentalizing effect toward the agents. As a result, we found that while appearance itself did not show significant difference in the attitudes, the mentalizing stimuli affected the attitudes in different ways depending on robots' appearances. This results showed that such elements as simple conversation with the agents and their appearance are important factors so that robots are treated more humanlike and as social beings. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{StrohkorbSebo2018,
abstract = {Successful teams are characterized by high levels of trust between team members, allowing the team to learn from mistakes, take risks, and entertain diverse ideas. We investigated a robot's potential to shape trust within a team through the robot's expressions of vul-nerability. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 35 teams, 105 participants) comparing the behavior of three human teammates collaborating with either a social robot making vulnera-ble statements or with a social robot making neutral statements. We found that, in a group with a robot making vulnerable statements, participants responded more to the robot's comments and directed more of their gaze to the robot, displaying a higher level of en-gagement with the robot. Additionally, we discovered that during times of tension, human teammates in a group with a robot making vulnerable statements were more likely to explain their failure to the group, console team members who had made mistakes, and laugh together, all actions that reduce the amount of tension expe-rienced by the team. These results suggest that a robot's vulnerable behavior can have " ripple effects " on their human team members' expressions of trust-related behavior.},
